I am an Engineer at the **Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IDSSE, CAS)**, focusing on the performance and efficiency of autonomous sailboats in complex marine environments.

My academic background includes a **Ph.D. in Mechatronic Engineering**, where I specialized in vessel performance via multidisciplinary design optimization. Later, as a postdoctoral researcher, I pivoted to **intelligent navigation**, bridging the gap between human sailing expertise and robotic control algorithms.

Currently, I integrate **system optimization** with **cognitive navigation strategies** to enable robust autonomous ocean observation.

I am always open to collaboration and discussion regarding autonomous and competitive sailing.
