I am currently an Engineer at the Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IDSSE, CAS). I am dedicated to enhancing the sailing performance and observation efficiency of autonomous sailboats in complex marine environments.<br><br>
  
  I hold a Ph.D. in Mechatronic Engineering. During my doctoral studies, my research primarily focused on enhancing vessel performance through multidisciplinary overall design optimization, laying a solid foundation in system engineering.<br><br>
  
  Subsequently, during my postdoctoral research, I expanded my focus to intelligent navigation. I began exploring the transfer of human sailing expertise to autonomous systems, aiming to bridge the gap between experienced human sailors and robotic algorithms.<br><br>
