This study develops a pioneering high-fidelity process plant model for unmanned sailboats with wing sails, implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. The 6-DoF multi-body dynamics framework incorporates frequency-domain hydrodynamics (via WAMIT), Morison equation-based fluid load modeling with precomputed CFD coefficients, and discretized panel methods for distributed foil forces. Validated through static sail/rudder force characterization and dynamic wave-response analysis, the modular model enables bidirectional coupling between rigid-body dynamics and environmental forces, providing a physically consistent tool for design optimization and control validation in realistic marine conditions.
