This paper proposes a novel velocity prediction program (VPP) framework tailored for autonomous sailing monohulls, addressing key limitations of traditional methods. By integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-compatible hydrodynamic models and an enhanced genetic algorithm (GA) solver with end-place optimization, the VPP achieves 40% faster convergence without prior performance estimates. Its innovative NIBO strategy leverages state continuity to reduce computational load by 30% while smoothing prediction fluctuations. Validated through numerical simulations and sea trials (error <15% in low-wind scenarios), this tool enables quantitative comparisons of unconventional hull-sail-keel configurations during conceptual design. The work, published in Applied Ocean Research (SCI Q2), establishes a foundation for autonomous sailboat optimization and mission planning.
