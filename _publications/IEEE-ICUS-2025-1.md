Addressing the critical challenge of dynamic water pollution control in fragile urban waters, this work proposes a real-time multi-USV coverage scheme integrating dynamic map interactions and motion constraints. Key innovations include synchronized inter-USV pollution dispersion mapping and distributed path optimization that minimizes redundant coverage. Simulation results validate high efficiency: deploying more USVs reduces monitoring time by up to 41% while maintaining coverage rates above 90%, significantly advancing autonomous environmental monitoring capabilities. This framework directly tackles limitations in existing static coverage methods, demonstrating practical value for rapidly evolving pollution scenarios.
